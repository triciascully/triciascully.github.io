## A New Post

After watching a few episodes of Voyager the other day, I decided to go on a hunt for Star Trek projects on Kaggle. I found some small beginnings of projects, but nothing notably extensive. I found [this Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/gjbroughton/start-trek-scripts) which was a nice beginning, so I decided to build off of what was in Gary's corresponding GitHub [repo](https://github.com/GJBroughton/Star_Trek_Scripts). 

Gary wrote some web scraping code to grab all the text from all the episodes of Star Trek across each series, and by each character, from the website [chakoteya.net](http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/index.html). Gary also wrote some data cleansing code that I will use. Thanks, Captain Gary!

Let's take a look at Gary's code, peek at the text that's pulled down, and see what we can do about some wordclouds, to see what words are emphasized in different Star Trek series.

Engage!

## First, Captain Gary's Scraping Code.
