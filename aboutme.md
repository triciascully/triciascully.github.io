I'm a translator at the core of me, and I work through various mediums.

### Data Science

I've been in the analytics field for about 5 years, translating piles of structured and unstructured data from raw records to actionable insights for a wide range of businesses in a wide range of roles. Have a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/triciascully/) for a more detailed description of the projects I've worked on in the real world, aside from these fun little projects here on this site.

### Photography

I've been capturing personality and emotion for corporate clients, private clients, and international publications for roughly a decade as a [professional photographer](https://www.triciascully.com).

### Videography

I'm a [videographer](https://www.triciascully.com/Videography) for corporate and private events and businesses as well, helping clients curate their messages and content to most effectively showcase their products and services to a wide audience with varying tastes.

### Music

Taking complex messages and turning them into compact 2 1/2 minute narratives has been a puzzle I've enjoyed solving through [songwriting](https://youtu.be/zVcdyamcC0c) and playing in various bands for almost 20 years. I've toured the US and a few cities in Europe, but I stick to small venues on weekends in Chicago as of late.

### Ice Hockey

I play left wing for the Frozen Snappers D2 team in the WCHL, because we all need to have a little fun sometimes.
