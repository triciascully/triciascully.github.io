I'm a translator at the core of me, and I work in various mediums.

### Data Science

I've been in the analytics field for about 5 years, translating piles of structured and unstructured data from raw records to actionable insights for a wide range of businesses in a wide range of roles. Check out my LinkedIn for a more detailed description of the projects I've worked on in the real world, aside from these fun little virtual projects here on this site.

### Photography

I've been capturing personality and emotion for corporate clients, private clients, and international publications for roughly a decade as a [triciascully.com](https://www.triciascully.com "professional photographer").

### Videography

I'm a [triciascully.com/Videography](https://www.triciascully.com/Videography "videographer") for corporate and private events and businesses as well, helping clients curate their messages and content to most effectively showcase their products and services to a wide audience with varying tastes.

### Music

Taking complex messages and turning them into compact 2 1/2 minute narratives has been a puzzle I've enjoyed solving through [music](https://youtu.be/zVcdyamcC0c "songwriting") and playing in various bands for almost 20 years. I've toured the US and a few cities in Europe, but I stick to small venues on weekend evenings in Chicago as of late.

### Ice Hockey

Because we all need to have a little fun sometimes.
